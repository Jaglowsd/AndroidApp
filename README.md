# AndroidApp
Android application using Android studio, restful web server, and MySQL database

The CafeDB file contains the MySQL tables that were used for the project.

Within the AndroidCafe file there are two directories. The CafeRest file has Java server that was used to communicate between the 
database and the android application. I used NetBeans and GlassFish to construct a RESTful web service.

The second file, CafeService, has the source code for the android application itself. Following this path CafeService/app/src/main/java/com/davidjaglowski/cafeservice/
are the activities for the application. The resources can be located from CafeService/app/src/main/res/layout/, whihch houses the UI 
of the application.
